@index.js You're helping me work on a c-gate mqtt bus proxy. The details can be found at @project-guide.md .

You also have a file @project-plan.md that is YOUR file. You can edit it, update is, and mark things off. Please read it to undersatnd where you're up to and to keep a diary of your changes.

Some of the key files for context are:
- @index.js The main javascript file for the project
- @cgateweb.service the linux service to run the script when installed.
- @cgate-manual.md manual for the c-gate web gateway sdk
- @settings.js where all settings are stored. Make sure to store any key settings in this file.
