  getall_networks:
    name: C-Bus Networks to Monitor
    description: >-
      List of C-Bus network IDs to poll for device states. The default network
      is 254, which is the standard C-Bus network number for most installations.
      To find your network IDs, open the C-Gate Toolkit application, expand your
      project, and look at the network numbers listed under it. You can also use
      Clipsal C-Bus Toolkit (CBAT) under Project > Network List.
  getall_on_start:
    name: Poll on Startup
    description: >-
      Request all device states when the add-on starts. Useful for
      synchronizing Home Assistant with the current state of all C-Bus devices.
  getall_period:
    name: Poll Interval (seconds)
    description: >-
      How often to request all device states, in seconds. Lower values
      provide fresher state but increase network traffic to C-Gate.
  retain_reads:
    name: Retain MQTT State Messages
    description: >-
      Set the MQTT retain flag on state messages. When enabled, new MQTT
      subscribers immediately receive the last known state of each device.
  message_interval:
    name: Command Interval (ms)
    description: >-
      Minimum delay between commands sent to C-Gate, in milliseconds.
      Prevents overwhelming C-Gate with rapid commands. Default 200ms.
  log_level:
    name: Log Level
    description: >-
      Logging verbosity. Use debug for troubleshooting, info for normal
      operation, warn for warnings only, or error for errors only.
  ha_discovery_enabled:
    name: Enable Home Assistant Discovery
    description: >-
      Automatically register C-Bus devices with Home Assistant using
      MQTT Discovery. Devices appear as entities without manual configuration.
  ha_discovery_prefix:
    name: Discovery Topic Prefix
    description: >-
      MQTT topic prefix for Home Assistant Discovery messages. This must
      match your Home Assistant MQTT discovery prefix (default: homeassistant).
  ha_discovery_networks:
    name: Discovery Networks
    description: >-
      C-Bus network IDs to scan for device discovery. Defaults to 254, the
      standard C-Bus network. If empty, falls back to the networks listed in
      "C-Bus Networks to Monitor". Most installations only have one network.
  ha_discovery_cover_app_id:
    name: Cover Application ID
    description: >-
      C-Bus application ID to treat as covers (blinds, shutters, garage doors).
      Common value is 203 (Enable Control). Leave empty to disable cover discovery.
  ha_discovery_switch_app_id:
    name: Switch Application ID
    description: >-
      C-Bus application ID to treat as switches. Leave empty to disable
      switch discovery.
  cgate_mode:
    name: C-Gate Mode
    description: >-
      How C-Gate is provided. "remote" connects to a C-Gate server running
      elsewhere on your network. "managed" downloads and runs C-Gate locally
      inside this add-on (requires Java and a C-Bus serial interface).
  cgate_install_source:
    name: C-Gate Install Source
    description: >-
      Only used when C-Gate Mode is "managed". "download" automatically
      downloads C-Gate from the official Clipsal URL on first start.
      "upload" looks for a C-Gate zip file you place in /share/cgate/.
  cgate_download_url:
    name: C-Gate Download URL
    description: >-
      Only used when C-Gate Mode is "managed" and Install Source is "download".
      Override the default URL if the official Clipsal download location changes.
      Leave empty to use the default URL.
  cbus_label_file:
    name: Custom Label File
    description: >-
      Path to a JSON file with custom device names for C-Bus groups. Generated
      by the import tool or the built-in label editor. Labels from this file
      take priority over names from C-Gate. Auto-detected from common paths
      if not set. The file is watched and changes are applied automatically.
